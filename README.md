Python reference implementation of the SuperFlux onset detection algorithm described in:

"Maximum Filter Vibrato Suppression for Onset Detection"
by Sebastian BÃ¶ck and Gerhard Widmer
in Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects
(DAFx-13), Maynooth, Ireland, September 2013

The paper can be downloaded from <http://phenicx.upf.edu/system/files/publications/Boeck_DAFx-13.pdf>.
